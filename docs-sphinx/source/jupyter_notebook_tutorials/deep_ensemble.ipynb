    "In this tutorial you learn how to use a neural network model called Deep Ensemble (DE) for the ENSO forecasting. This network architecture was initially developed [Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7219-simple-and-scalable-predictive-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-ensembles.pdf). \n",
